# Introduction #

The **MUtilities** library is a collection of routines and classes to extend the [*Qt cross-platform framework*](http://qt-project.org/). It contains various convenience and utility functions as well as wrappers for OS-specific functionalities. The library was originally created as a "side product" of the [**LameXP**](http://lamexp.sourceforge.net/) application: Over the years, a lot of code, **not** really specific to *LameXP*, had accumulated in the *LameXP* code base. Some of that code even had been used in other projects too, in a "copy & paste" fashion &ndash; which had lead to redundancy and much complicated maintenance. In order to clean-up the LameXP code base, to eliminate the ugly redundancy and to simplify maintenance, the code in question has finally been refactored into the **MUtilities** (aka "MuldeR's Utilities for Qt") library. This library now forms the foundation of *LameXP* and [*other OpenSource projects*](https://github.com/lordmulder).


# Project Structure

The *MUtilities* project directory is organized as follows:

* `bin/` &ndash; compiled library files (static or shared), link those files in projects that use the MUtilities library
* `docs/` &ndash; programming interface documentation, generated with Doxygen tool
* `etc/` &ndash; miscellaneous files, everything that doesn't fit in anywhere else
* `include/` &ndash; public header files, include this directory in projects that use the MUtilities library
* `obj/` &ndash; object code files, intermediate files generated during the build process
* `res/` &ndash; resource files, required for building the MUtilities library
* `src/` &ndash; source code files, required for building the MUtilities library (third-party code in `src/3rd_party/`)
* `test/` &ndash; unit tests, based on Google Test framework
* `tmp/` &ndash; temporary files, automatically generated during the build process


# Example

Here is a minimal example on how to use the *MUtilities* library in your project:

    //MUtils
    #include <MUtils/Global.h>
    
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        qDebug("Random number: %u\n", MUtils::next_rand_u32());
    }

## Build Notes

* In order to use the *MUtilities* library in your project, your build environment must have already been set up for building Qt-based projects. Setting up Qt is *not* covered by this document.
* Additionally, make sure that *MUtilities'* `include/` directory is contained in your "Additional Include Directories" and that the *MUtilities'* `bin/` directory is contained in your "Additional Library Directories".
* Finally, make sure that your project links against the `MUtils32-1.lib` library file. For each build configuration, pick the proper **.lib** file from the corresponding `bin/<platform>/<config>/` directory!
* If your projects intends to use the *MUtilities* library as a **static** library, then the macro `MUTILS_STATIC_LIB` *must* be added to your project's "Preprocessor Definitions".


# API Documentation

A fully-fledged documentation of the *MUtilities* programming interface (API) is available thanks to [*Doxygen*](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). Please see [**`docs/index.html`**](docs/index.html) for details!

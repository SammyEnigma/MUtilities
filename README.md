# Introduction #

The **MUtilities** library is a collection of routines and classes to extend the [*Qt cross-platform framework*](http://qt-project.org/). It contains various convenience and utility functions as well as wrappers for OS-specific functionalities. The library was originally created as a "side product" of the [**LameXP**](http://lamexp.sourceforge.net/) application: Over the years, a lot of code, **not** really specific to *LameXP*, had accumulated in the *LameXP* code base. Some of that code even had been used in other projects too, in a "copy & paste" fashion &ndash; which had lead to redundancy and much complicated maintenance. In order to clean-up the LameXP code base, to eliminate the ugly redundancy and to simplify maintenance, the code in question has finally been refactored into the **MUtilities** (aka "MuldeR's Utilities for Qt") library. This library now forms the foundation of *LameXP* and [*other OpenSource projects*](https://github.com/lordmulder).


# Project Structure

The *MUtilities* project directory is structured as follows:

* `bin/` &ndash; compiled library files (static or shared), link those files in projects that use the MUtilities library
* `docs/` &ndash; programming interface documentation, generated with Doxygen tool
* `etc/` &ndash; miscellaneous files, everything that doesn't fit in anywhere else
* `include/` &ndash; public header files, include this directory in projects that use the MUtilities library
* `obj/` &ndash; object code files, intermediate files generated during the build process
* `res/` &ndash; resouce files, required for building the MUtilities library
* `src/` &ndash; source code files, required for building the MUtilities library (third-party code in `src/3rd_party/`)
* `test/` &ndash; unit tests, based on Google Test framework
* `tmp/` &ndash; temporary files, automatically generated during the build process


# API Documentation

A fully-fledged documentation of the *MUtilities* programming interface (API) is available thanks to [*Doxygen*](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). Please see [**`docs/index.html`**](docs/index.html) for details!

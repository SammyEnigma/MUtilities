 * # Introduction #
 * 
 * The **MUtilities** library is a collection of routines and classes to extend the [*Qt cross-platform framework*](http://qt-project.org/). It contains various convenience and utility functions as well as wrappers for OS-specific functionalities. The library was originally created as a "side product" of the [**LameXP**](http://lamexp.sourceforge.net/) application: Over the years, a lot of code, **not** really specific to *LameXP*, had accumulated in the *LameXP* code base. Some of that code even had been used in other projects too, in a "copy & paste" fashion &ndash; which had lead to redundancy and much complicated maintenance. In order to clean-up the LameXP code base, to eliminate the ugly redundancy and to simplify maintenance, the code in question has finally been refactored into the **MUtilities** (aka "MuldeR's Utilities for Qt") library. This library now forms the foundation of *LameXP* and [*other OpenSource projects*](https://github.com/lordmulder).

 * # API Documentation
 * 
 * The public API of the *MUtilities* library is defined in the following header files (select file for details):
 * - **Global.h** &ndash; miscellaneous useful functions
 * - **CPUFeatures.h** &ndash; functions for detection information about the CPU
 * - **Hash.h** &ndash; functions for cryptographic hash computation
 * - **JobObject.h** &ndash; functions for creating and managing job objects
 * 
 * 
 * # Example
 * 
 * Here is a minimal example on how to use the *MUtilities* library in your project:
 * 
 *     //MUtils
 *     #include <MUtils/Global.h>
 *     
 *     int main(int argc, char **argv)
 *     {
 *         qDebug("Random number: %u\n", MUtils::next_rand_u32());
 *     }

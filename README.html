	<h2>About this Library</h2>
	<p>This library is a collection of routines and classes to extend the <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt cross-platform framework</a>. It contains various convenience and utility functions as well as wrappers for OS-specific functionalities. The library was originally created as a "side product" of the <a href="http://lamexp.sourceforge.net/">LameXP</a> application: Over the years, a lot of code, <i>not</i> really specific to LameXP, had accumulated in the LameXP code base. Some of that code even had been used in other projects too, in a "copy & paste" fashion &ndash; which had lead to redundancy and much complicated maintenance. In order to clean-up the LameXP code base, to eliminate the ugly redundancy and to simplify maintenance, the code in question has finally been refactored into the <i>MUtilities</i> (aka "MuldeR's Utilities for Qt") library. This library now forms the foundation of LameXP and various other OpenSource projects.
